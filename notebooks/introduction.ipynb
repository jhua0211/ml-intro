    "# Artificial intelligence\n",
    "[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) says:\n",
    "> Colloquially, the term \"artificial intelligence\" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic \"cognitive\" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as \"learning\" and \"problem solving\".\n",

    "## Machine learning\n",
    "[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) says:\n",
    ">Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses data and optimization. Machines do not learn. They find a mathematical function to produce outputs given inputs. Slightly changing the input will usually cause failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sub-branches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Supervised learning:** The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. -Discete Calssifications and Regression\n",
    "- **Unsupervised learning:** No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).-no labels, clustering\n",
    "- **Reinforcement learning:** A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximize.-an example is atari games\n",

    "### Deep learning\n",
    "[Wikipwdia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) says:\n",
    ">Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.\n",
