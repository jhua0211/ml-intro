1. Download the data
1. Prepare the data
    1. A look at the data files
    1. Loading the data with Pandas
    1. Getting an overview by visualizing the data
    1. Create feature matrix and target vector
    1. Create training and validation sets
1. Machine learning: Supervised classification  
    1. Train a model
    1. Compare training and validation accuracy
    1. The confusion matrix
    1. Summarize the different scores
